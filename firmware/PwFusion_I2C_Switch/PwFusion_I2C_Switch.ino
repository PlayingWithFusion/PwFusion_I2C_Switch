* ADDITIONAL NOTES:
* This file contains functions to flash an AtTiny841-MMHR included in
* the Playing with Fusion i2c toggle switch interface board (IFB-40004).
* Funcionality is as described below:
*   - Read values from the toggle switch componet
*   - Pack values into a register struct
*   - Send values over the i2c bus when requested
